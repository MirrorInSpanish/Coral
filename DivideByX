//Write a program using integers userNum and x as input, and output userNum divided by x four times.

//Declare variables userNum and x
integer userNum
integer x

//Takes the first user input and assigns the value to userNum, assigns second value for user input to x
userNum = Get next input
x 	= Get next input

//Evaluates userNum divided by x and assigns value to userNum
userNum = userNum / x

//Outputs userNum
Put userNum to output

//Outputs " "
Put " " to output

//Second evaluation for userNum divided by x and assigns value to userNum
userNum = userNum / x

//Outputs userNum
Put userNum to output

//Outputs " "
Put " " to output

//Third evaluation for userNum divided by x and assigns value to userNum
userNum = userNum / x

//Outputs userNum
Put userNum to output

//Outputs " "
Put " " to output

//Forth evaluation for userNum divided by x and assigns value to userNum
userNum = userNum / x

//Outputs userNum
Put userNum to output
