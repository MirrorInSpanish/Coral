//Given integer values red, green, and blue, subtract the gray from each value.
//Computers represent color by combining the sub-colors red, green, and blue (rgb).
//Each sub-colors value can range from 0 to 255. Thus (255, 0, 0) is bright red, (130, 0, 130) is a medium purple, (0, 0, 0) is black, (255, 255, 255) is white, and (40, 40, 40) is a dark gray.
//(130, 50, 130) is a faded purple, due to the (50, 50, 50) gray part. (In other words, equal amounts of red, green, blue yield gray).
//Given values red, green, and blue, remove the gray part.
