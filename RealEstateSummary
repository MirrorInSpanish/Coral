//Sites like Zillow get input about house prices from a database and provide nice summaries.
//Write a program with two inputs, current price and last months price (both integers).
//Then, output a summary listing the price, the change since last month, and the estimated monthly mortgage computed as (currentPrice * 0.045) / 12.
//Output the estimated monthly mortgage (estMortgage) with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
//Put estMortgage to output with 2 decimal places

//Declare integer variables currPrice, lastMonthPrice, and priceChange
//Declare float variable estMortgage
integer currPrice
integer lastMonthPrice
float estMortgage
integer priceChange

//Assigns the first user input to currPrice, assigns the second user input to lastMonthPrice
currPrice = Get next input
lastMonthPrice = Get next input


//Evaluates currPrice subtracted by lastMonthPrice and assigns the value to priceChange
priceChange = currPrice - lastMonthPrice

//Evaluates currPrice multiplied by 0.045, then divides that evaluation by 12 and assigns the value to estMortgage
estMortgage = (currPrice * 0.045) / 12

//Outputs "This house is $"
Put "This house is $" to output

//Outputs currPrice
Put currPrice to output

//Outputs ". "
Put ". " to output

//Outputs "The change is $"
Put "The change is $" to output

//Outputs priceChange
Put priceChange to output

//Outputs " since last month." with a line break
Put " since last month.\n" to output

//Outputs "The estimated monthly mortgage is $"
Put "The estimated monthly mortgage is $" to output

//Outputs estMortgage
Put estMortgage to output with 2 decimal places

//Outputs "."
Put "." to output
