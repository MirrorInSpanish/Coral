//Sites like Zillow get input about house prices from a database and provide nice summaries.
//Write a program with two inputs, current price and last months price (both integers).
//Then, output a summary listing the price, the change since last month, and the estimated monthly mortgage computed as (currentPrice * 0.045) / 12.
//Output the estimated monthly mortgage (estMortgage) with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
//Put estMortgage to output with 2 decimal places

integer currPrice
integer lastMonthPrice
float estMortgage
integer priceChange

currPrice = Get next input
lastMonthPrice = Get next input


// Your solution goes here
priceChange = currPrice - lastMonthPrice
estMortgage = (currPrice * 0.045) / 12

Put "This house is $" to output
Put currPrice to output
Put ". " to output
Put "The change is $" to output
Put priceChange to output
Put " since last month.\n" to output
Put "The estimated monthly mortgage is $" to output
Put estMortgage to output with 2 decimal places
Put "." to output
