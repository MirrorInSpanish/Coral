//Primary U.S. interstate highways are numbered 1-99.
//Odd numbers (like the 5 or 95) go north/south, and evens (like the 10 or 90) go east/west.
//Auxiliary highways are numbered 100-999, and service the primary highway indicated by the rightmost two digits.
//Thus, the 405 services the 5, and the 290 services the 90.
//Given a highway number, indicate whether it is a primary or auxiliary highway.
//If auxiliary, indicate what primary highway it serves.
//Also indicate if the (primary) highway runs north/south or east/west.
