//Write a program with total change amount as an integer input, and output the change using the fewest coins, one coin type per line.
//End each line with a newline. The coin types are dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.
//Use singular and plural coin names as appropriate, like 1 penny vs. 2 pennies.
