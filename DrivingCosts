//Driving is expensive. Write a program with a car's miles/gallon and gas dollars/gallon (both floats) as input, and output the gas cost for 10 miles, 50 miles, and 400 miles.
//Output the gas cost (gasCost) with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
//Put gasCost to output with 2 decimal places

float 	mileGallon
float 	dollarGallon
float 	gasCost
integer miles

mileGallon 	= Get next input
dollarGallon 	= Get next input
miles		= 10
gasCost 	=  miles/mileGallon * dollarGallon
Put gasCost to output with 2 decimal places
Put " " to output
miles		= 50
gasCost 	=  miles/mileGallon * dollarGallon
Put gasCost to output with 2 decimal places
Put " " to output
miles		= 400
gasCost 	=  miles/mileGallon * dollarGallon
Put gasCost to output with 2 decimal places
