//Driving is expensive. Write a program with a car's miles/gallon and gas dollars/gallon (both floats) as input, and output the gas cost for 10 miles, 50 miles, and 400 miles.
//Output the gas cost (gasCost) with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
//Put gasCost to output with 2 decimal places

//Declare float variables mileGallon, dollarGallon, and gasCost
//Declares integer variable miles
float 	mileGallon
float 	dollarGallon
float 	gasCost
integer miles

//Takes the first user input and assigns the value to mileGallon, assigns second value for user input to dollarGallon
mileGallon 	= Get next input
dollarGallon 	= Get next input

//Assigns the value 10 to miles
miles		= 10

//Evaluates miles divided by mileGallon, then multiplies the result by dollarGallon and assigns value to gasCost
gasCost 	=  miles/mileGallon * dollarGallon

//Outputs gasCost with 2 decimal places, example 0.10
Put gasCost to output with 2 decimal places

//Outputs " "
Put " " to output

//Assigns the value 50 to miles
miles		= 50

//Evaluates miles divided by mileGallon, then multiplies the result by dollarGallon and assigns value to gasCost
gasCost 	=  miles/mileGallon * dollarGallon

//Outputs gasCost with 2 decimal places, example 3.25
Put gasCost to output with 2 decimal places

//Outputs " "
Put " " to output

//Assigns the value 400 to miles
miles		= 400

//Evaluates miles divided by mileGallon, then multiplies the result by dollarGallon and assigns value to gasCost
gasCost 	=  miles/mileGallon * dollarGallon

//Outputs gasCost with 2 decimal places, example 5.50
Put gasCost to output with 2 decimal places
