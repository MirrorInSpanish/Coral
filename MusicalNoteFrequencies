//On a piano, a key has a frequency, say f0. Each higher key (black or white) has a frequency of f0 * rn, where n is the distance (number of keys) from that key, and r is 2(1.0/12.0).
//Given an initial key frequency, output that frequency and the next 4 higher key frequencies.
//Output all frequencies with five digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
//Put frequency to output with 5 decimal places

//Declare float variables frequency, r, and nextFrequency
float frequency
float r
float nextFrequency

//Takes the user input and assigns the value to frequency
frequency = Get next input

//Evaluates 1.0 divided by 12.0, then raises 2 to the power of the evaluated value, then assigns r with the final evaluation
r = RaiseToPower(2,(1.0 / 12.0))

//Outputs frequency with 5 decimal places, example 0.12345 or 10.13285
Put frequency to output with 5 decimal places

//Outputs " "
Put " " to output

//Evaluates r raised to the power of 1, then multiplies the evaluation by frequency, then assigns nextFrequency with the final evaluation
nextFrequency = frequency * RaiseToPower(r,1)

//Outputs nextFrequency with 5 decimal places, example 0.12345 or 10.13285
Put nextFrequency to output with 5 decimal places

//Outputs " "
Put " " to output

//Evaluates r raised to the power of 2, then multiplies the evaluation by frequency, then assigns nextFrequency with the final evaluation
nextFrequency = frequency * RaiseToPower(r,2)

//Outputs frequency with 5 decimal places, example 0.12345 or 10.13285
Put nextFrequency to output with 5 decimal places

//Outputs " "
Put " " to output

//Evaluates r raised to the power of 3, then multiplies the evaluation by frequency, then assigns nextFrequency with the final evaluation
nextFrequency = frequency * RaiseToPower(r,3)

//Outputs frequency with 5 decimal places, example 0.12345 or 10.13285
Put nextFrequency to output with 5 decimal places

//Outputs " "
Put " " to output

//Evaluates r raised to the power of 4, then multiplies the evaluation by frequency, then assigns nextFrequency with the final evaluation
nextFrequency = frequency * RaiseToPower(r,4)

//Outputs frequency with 5 decimal places, example 0.12345 or 10.13285
Put nextFrequency to output with 5 decimal places
