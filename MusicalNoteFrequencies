//On a piano, a key has a frequency, say f0. Each higher key (black or white) has a frequency of f0 * rn, where n is the distance (number of keys) from that key, and r is 2(1.0/12.0).
//Given an initial key frequency, output that frequency and the next 4 higher key frequencies.
//Output all frequencies with five digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
//Put frequency to output with 5 decimal places

float frequency
float r
float nextFrequency

frequency = Get next input
r = RaiseToPower(2,(1.0 / 12.0))

Put frequency to output with 5 decimal places
Put " " to output

nextFrequency = frequency * RaiseToPower(r,1)
Put nextFrequency to output with 5 decimal places
Put " " to output

nextFrequency = frequency * RaiseToPower(r,2)
Put nextFrequency to output with 5 decimal places
Put " " to output

nextFrequency = frequency * RaiseToPower(r,3)
Put nextFrequency to output with 5 decimal places
Put " " to output

nextFrequency = frequency * RaiseToPower(r,4)
Put nextFrequency to output with 5 decimal places
