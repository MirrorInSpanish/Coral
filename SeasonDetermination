//Write a program that takes a date as input and outputs the date's season.
//The input is an integer to represent the month and an integer to represent the day.
//In addition, check if both integers are valid (an actual month and day).

//The dates for each season are:
//spring: March 20 - June 20
//summer: June 21 - September 21
//autumn: September 22 - December 20
//winter: December 21 - March 19


//Declare variables day and month
integer day
integer month

//Assigns first user input to variable month, assigns second user input to variable day
month = Get next input
day   = Get next input

// Evaluates month is less than 1, then month is great then 12, then day is less than 1, then day is greater than 31
//If any evaluation is true outputs "invalid", if false moves to next elseif statement
if          (month < 1) or (month > 12) or (day < 1) or (day > 31)
   Put "invalid" to output

//Evaluates month is equiavlent to 3 and day is greater than or equivalent to 20
//Evaluates if month is equivalent to 4, then if month is equivalent to 5
//Evaluates month is equivalent to 6 and day is less than or equivalent to 20
//If all evaluations are true outputs "spring", if false moves to next elseif statement
elseif      ((month == 3) and (day >= 20)) or month == 4 or month ==5 or ((month == 6) and (day <= 20)) 
   Put "spring" to output

//Evaluates month is equiavlent to 6 and day is greater than or equivalent to 22
//Evaluates if month is equivalent to 7, then if month is equivalent to 8
//Evaluates month is equivalent to 9 and day is less than or equivalent to 21
//If all evaluations are true outputs "summer", if false moves to next elseif statement
elseif      ((month == 6) and (day >= 21)) or month == 7 or month == 8 or ((month == 9) and (day <= 21)) 
   Put "summer" to output

//Evaluates month is equiavlent to 9 and day is greater than or equivalent to 22
//Evaluates if month is equivalent to 10, then if month is equivalent to 11
//Evaluates month is equivalent to 12 and day is less than or equivalent to 20
//If all evaluations are true outputs "autumn", if false moves to next elseif statement
elseif      ((month == 9) and (day >= 22)) or month == 10 or month == 11 or ((month == 12) and (day <= 20)) 
   Put "autumn" to output

//Evaluates month is equiavlent to 12 and day is greater than or equivalent to 22
//Evaluates if month is equivalent to 1, then if month is equivalent to 2
