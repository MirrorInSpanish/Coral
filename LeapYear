//A year in the modern Gregorian Calendar consists of 365 days.
//In reality, the earth takes longer to rotate around the sun.
//To account for the difference in time, every 4 years, a leap year takes place.
//A leap year is when a year has 366 days: An extra day, February 29th.
//The requirements for a given year to be a leap year are:
//1) The year must be divisible by 4
//2) If the year is a century year (1700, 1800, etc.), the year must be evenly divisible by 400
//Some example leap years are 1600, 1712, and 2016.
//Write a program that takes in a year and determines whether that year is a leap year.

//Declare variable inputYear
integer inputYear

//Takes the user input and assigns the value to inputYear
inputYear = Get next input

//Checks if the remainder of inputYear divided by 400 is equivalent to 0. If statement evaluate to true outputs inputYear, then outputs " is a leap year." - If false moves on to elseif statement
if ((inputYear % 400) == 0)
   Put inputYear to output
   Put " is a leap year." to output

//Checks if the remainder of inputYear divided by 4 is equivalent to 0 and if the remainder of inputYear divided by 100 is not equivalent to 0.
//If statement evaluate to true outputs inputYear, then outputs " is a leap year." - If false moves on to else statement
elseif ((inputYear % 4) == 0) and (inputYear % 100 != 0) 
   Put inputYear to output
   Put " is a leap year." to output  

//If all statements evalue to false outputs input year, then outputs " is not a leap year."
else   
   Put inputYear to output
   Put " is not a leap year." to output
