//Using 3 integers, output the average and product using integer arithmetic.
//Then
//Using the same 3 integers, output the average and product using floating-point arithmetic.
//Output all floating-point numbers with five digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
//Put x to output with 5 decimal places

//Declare variables num1, num2, num3, avgNum, and productNum
//Declare float decAvg
integer num1
integer num2
integer num3
integer avgNum
integer productNum
float decAvg

//Assigns first user input to variable num1, assigns second user input to num2, assigns third user input to num3
num1        = Get next input
num2        = Get next input
num3        = Get next input

//Evaluates num1 + num2 + num3, then divides the result by 3 and assigns avgNum with the value
avgNum      = (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3

//Outputs avgNum
Put avgNum to output

//Outputs " "
Put " " to output

//Evaluates num1 multiplied by num2 multiplied by num3, then assigns productNum with the value
productNum  = num1 * num2 * num3

//Outputs productNum
Put productNum to output

//Outputs a linebreak
Put "\n" to output

//Evaluates num1 + num2 + num3, then divides the result by 3 and assigns decAvg with the value
decAvg = (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3.0

//Outputs decAvg with a 5 decimal places, example 0.12345 or 9.68164
Put decAvg to output with 5 decimal places

//Outputs " "
Put " " to output

//Evaluates num1 multiplied by num2 multiplied by num3, then assigns productNum with the value
productNum  = num1 * num2 * num3

//Outputs productNum with a 5 decimal places, example 0.12345 or 9.68164
Put productNum to output with 5 decimal places
