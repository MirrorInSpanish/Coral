//Using 3 integers, output the average and product using floating-point arithmetic.
//Output all floating-point numbers with five digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
//Put x to output with 5 decimal places

integer num1
integer num2
integer num3
integer avgNum
integer productNum
float decAvg

num1        = Get next input
num2        = Get next input
num3        = Get next input

avgNum      = (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3

Put avgNum to output
Put " " to output

productNum  = num1 * num2 * num3

Put productNum to output
Put "\n" to output

decAvg = (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3.0

Put decAvg to output with 5 decimal places
Put " " to output

productNum  = num1 * num2 * num3

Put productNum to output with 5 decimal places
