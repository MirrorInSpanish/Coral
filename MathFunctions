//Given three floating-point numbers x, y, and z, output xy, x(yz), the absolute value of x, and the square root of ((x * y)z).
//Output all results with five digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
//Put result to output with 5 decimal places

//Declare float variables x, y, z, solution1, solution2, solution3, and solution4
float x
float y
float z
float solution1
float solution2
float solution3
float solution4

//Takes the first user input and assigns the value to x, assigns second value for user input to y, assigns thrird value for user input to z
x = Get next input
y = Get next input
z = Get next input

//Evaluates each built-in Coral math function on the right with the values for x and y, then assigns the value to the corresponding varaible on the left
solution1 = RaiseToPower(x,y)
solution2 = RaiseToPower(x,RaiseToPower(y,z))
solution3 = AbsoluteValue(x)
solution4 = SquareRoot(RaiseToPower((x*y),z))

//Outputs solution1 with 5 decimal places, example 0.12345 or 10.13285
Put solution1 to output with 5 decimal places

//Outputs " "
Put " " to output

//Outputs solution2 with 5 decimal places, example 0.12345 or 10.13285
Put solution2 to output with 5 decimal places

//Outputs " "
Put " " to output

//Outputs solution3 with 5 decimal places, example 0.12345 or 10.13285
Put solution3 to output with 5 decimal places

//Outputs " "
Put " " to output

//Outputs solution4 with 5 decimal places, example 0.12345 or 10.13285
Put solution4 to output with 5 decimal places
