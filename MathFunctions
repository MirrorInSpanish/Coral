//Given three floating-point numbers x, y, and z, output xy, x(yz), the absolute value of x, and the square root of ((x * y)z).
//Output all results with five digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
//Put result to output with 5 decimal places

float x
float y
float z
float solution1
float solution2
float solution3
float solution4

x = Get next input
y = Get next input
z = Get next input

solution1 = RaiseToPower(x,y)
solution2 = RaiseToPower(x,RaiseToPower(y,z))
solution3 = AbsoluteValue(x)
solution4 = SquareRoot(RaiseToPower((x*y),z))

Put solution1 to output with 5 decimal places
Put " " to output
Put solution2 to output with 5 decimal places
Put " " to output
Put solution3 to output with 5 decimal places
Put " " to output
Put solution4 to output with 5 decimal places
