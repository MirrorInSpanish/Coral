//Write a program that reads three integers as inputs, and outputs the largest of the three values.

integer a
integer b
integer c

a = Get next input
b = Get next input
c = Get next input

if (a > b) and (a > c)
   Put a to output
if (b > a) and (b > c)
   Put b to output
if (c > a) and (c > b)
   Put c to output
elseif (a == b) 
   Put a to output
elseif (b == c)
   Put b to output
