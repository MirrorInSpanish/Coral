//Write a program that reads three integers as inputs, and outputs the largest of the three values.

//Declare variables a, b, and c
integer a
integer b
integer c

//Takes the first user input and assigns the value to a, assigns second value for user input to b, assigns thrird value for user input to c
a = Get next input
b = Get next input
c = Get next input

//Checks if the evaluation of both a is greater than b and a is greater than c. If both statements evaluate to true, outputs a - If false moves on to the next if statement.
if (a > b) and (a > c)
   Put a to output

//Checks if the evaluation of both b is greater than a and b is greater than c. If both statements evaluate to true, outputs b - If false moves on to the next if statement.
if (b > a) and (b > c)
   Put b to output

//Checks if the evaluation of both c is greater than c and c is greater than b. If both statements evaluate to true, outputs c - If false moves on to the next elseif statement.
if (c > a) and (c > b)
   Put c to output

//Checks if the evaluation of a is equivalent to b. If statement evaluate to true, outputs a - If false moves on to the next elseif statement.
elseif (a == b) 
   Put a to output

//Checks if the evaluation of b is equivalent to c. If statement evaluate to true, outputs b - If false moves on to the next elseif statement.
elseif (b == c)
   Put b to output
